# My Productivity Stack

I was recently asked what tools I use to be productive during my workday, my "Productivity stack". Staying organized and focused is essential for me. I wanted to share how these six applications are absolute game-changers for me. 🙌

## 📸 [CleanShot X](http://cleanshot.com)

My attention to detail is a strength, but it can also be overwhelming. CleanShot X allows me to capture and annotate screenshots in an intuitive way. When everything needs to be just right, this tool helps me communicate clearly.

## 💬 [TextExpander](http://textexpander.com)

Being autistic means I sometimes struggle with switching tasks. TextExpander is a lifesaver. It enables me to use keyboard shortcuts for common phrases or responses. This means less cognitive load when switching between tasks like emailing and project work.

## 📅 [In Your Face](http://inyourface.app)

Time management can be challenging. The usual pop-up reminders just don't cut it for me. "In Your Face" quite literally does what it says. The notifications are impossible to ignore, helping me stay on track and never miss an important meeting.

## 🍸 [Bartender](https://lnkd.in/exWcjwUz)

A cluttered interface can be particularly distracting for me. Bartender cleans up my menu bar so I can focus on one task at a time. With fewer distractions, my focus is laser-sharp!

## 📋 [Paste](https://pasteapp.io)

Memory can sometimes fail us all, but it especially troubles me when I'm deep into a task. Paste is my clipboard manager that keeps track of the things I've copied. No more flipping between windows to find that crucial piece of info.

## 🔍 [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)

Finally, there's Alfred—my digital butler. It reduces the steps required to complete tasks, helping me to maintain focus and reduce stress. It's customizable, which is great for setting up workflows that suit my unique way of processing information.
