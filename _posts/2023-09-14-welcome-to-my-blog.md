## Welcome

Hi there. This is my new blog.

My good friend and colleague [Russell Mccloy](http://russellmccloy.github.io) (and [Jay Blake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-blake-ev-chargers/) ) suggested, I start keeping a reccord of my activiites, and experiances.

I have kept many blogs over the years, but have had problems with keeping up with posting. I also struggled with a decent blogging platform. Russell suggested I take a look at, [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Ulike other platforms (such as Wordpress) **Jekyll** allows me to write my blog within **VSCode** and push to a **GitHub** repository to publish it. I really like this idea as it fits with the workflow that I use every day in my development practices.

**I like writing and having a blog for the following reasons:**

- It helps me solidify my learning by forcing me to write it down. I feel this helps fully embed the knowledge in my slightly forgetful mind.
- It is not to show off but, if it helps others, that's great.
- Allows me to talk about my experiances, and provide my insights.
